        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
            <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
            <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
        </ul>
